# Containment-of-the-Universe-in-Pi

This simple program, with the right hardware, could locate the unique representation every object in the universe in the digits of pi




THE MATH:

Every object, no matter how complicated, can be converted into a string of binary digits.

If you include spacial coordinates and a time coordinate to this, you can essentially fit every object at every stage 

Consider the following Theorem:

Every Normal number contains every all strings.

More expressely, the sequence of digits of a a normal number, say c, contains every finite subsequence of the same digits. 

Now although it has not been proven that pi is a normal number, we have every reason to believe that it is. I'm sure I could have titled this repository "The Containment of the Universe in Champernowne's number", but even as a math major/afficianado, I havent even heard of this number. The truth is the power of this statement comes much from the recognition of such a constant as pi. 


So since we can desbribe every object, at every time in its existence, as a string of digits, and that every string of digits is contained in every normal number, therefore every normal number contains a representation of every possible thing that has happened, is happening, or will ever happen in the universe.
