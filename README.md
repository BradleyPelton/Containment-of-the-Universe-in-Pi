# Containment-of-the-Universe-in-Pi

This simple program, with the right hardware, could locate the unique representation every object in the universe in the digits of pi

Theorem: a finite number of frames, a finite number of objects being described by a finite string. From the big bang to the heat death of the universe, everthing that will ever happen will be entirely described and contained in the single constant Pi.

(proof too long to be contained in the margins)

THE MATH:

Every object, no matter how complicated, can be converted into a string of binary digits.

If you include spacial coordinates and a time coordinate to this, you can essentially fit every object at every stage 

Consider the following Theorem:

Every Normal number contains every all strings.

More expressely, the sequence of digits of a a normal number, say c, contains every finite subsequence of the same digits. 

Now although it has not been proven that pi is a normal number, we have every reason to believe that it is. I'm sure I could have titled this repository "The Containment of the Universe in Champernowne's number", but even as a math major/afficianado, I havent even heard of this number. The truth is the power of this statement comes much from the recognition of such a constant as pi. 


So since we can desbribe every object, at every time in its existence, as a string of digits, and that every string of digits is contained in every normal number, therefore every normal number contains a representation of every possible thing that has happened, is happening, or will ever happen in the universe.

Assumptions A: There is a smallest object, sub atomic ofcourse, in the universe has a non-zero, non-infinitesimal weight. Every object is created by a finite collection of these objects(as well as other objects larger than it).

Assumption B: An exact replica of the human brain, down to the exact same number of sub-atomic particles in the same exact location, would hold the exact same beliefs, ideas, and thoughts. 

Conclusion 1: A picture-perfect snapshot of the universe would encapsulate all the beliefs, ideas, and thoughts of all the beings in it.(see assumption B)

Assumption C: There is a shortest "duration" in which every action takes place at that speed or slower.(Omega)

Conclusion 2: 13.8 billion years since the big bang. 13.8 billion years/Omega. This would yield the most "frames" we would need to perfectly portray the universe

Assumption D: A collection of these "frames" could perfectly portra ever action
Assumption E: The exact description of every object would not lose any information about the Universe.

Therefore: a finite number of frames, a finite number of objects being described by a finite string. From the big bang to the heat death of the universe, everthing that will ever happen, in all of its numerous complexities, will be entirely described and contained in the single constant Pi
