First we need a to convert our object into a base-10 string of numbers. 

We can start out by proving that every picture of defined resolution is containted in the digits of pi and generalize from there.

Given a picture of resolution, converting it into base-10 is the hard part.

pic_str= '234895720398475029837450892730489572345.....'
#pic_str is the conversion of the picture into base-10

#lets open a file that contains a billion digits of pi or so 

filename= 'billion_digits_of_pi'

pie=''
while open(filename) as file_objecti:
  lines = file_object.read.lines()

for line in lines:
  pie+= line.strip()
  
pie.find(pic_str)

And we have it. The line above would output the occurence of the base-10 representation of the picture in pi
